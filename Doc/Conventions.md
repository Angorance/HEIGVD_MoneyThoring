#Conventions

**DISCLAIMER: I'm going to be FUCKING ANNOYING with that. Enjoy :)**

*First of all: This document is in English. Why? Because we're programmers, we're going to code in English. Then, if something isn't clear, don't assume. Ask. If you do something wrong, you're the one who's going to lose time!*

Now, concerning global rules:

+ English comments and variable/method/class names
+ camelCase and classic Java conventions
